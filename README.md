# Project Overview
This repository contains on-going research and implementation details for "Securing the Internet of Things: Comparing Classification Methods for Adversarial Network Activity Detection." The project investigates various machine learning classification techniques to detect adversarial activities in IoT networks effectively. It particularly focuses on ensemble methods and SVM (Support Vector Machine).
